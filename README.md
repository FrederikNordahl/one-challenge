# one.com code challenge

This repo is for showcasing next.js splitup of api and frontend (and completing the code challenge)

I also used this opportunity to play a little with an animated text package that I'm considering throwin on npm.

Lastly, I focused on displaying the versatility of next.js and it's api backend. I was going to also add server-side renderen components and stream it into the app, but time runs fast :(
